# Project: AgriConnect CRM â€“ A Farmer Support & Crop Advisory System 

## Phase 2: Salesforce Setup and Configuration

### What I Accomplished in This Phase

In this phase, I built the foundational data structure for the AgriConnect CRM within a Salesforce Developer Org. This setup is designed to address the key challenges outlined in the problem statement, such as fragmented data and inefficient support distribution. 

The key activities included:

1.  **Created a Custom Lightning App:** I built the "AgriConnect CRM" app to serve as the central hub for all users. 
2.  **Designed a Custom Data Model:** I created four core custom objects to store essential information:
    * **Farmer:** To maintain a 360-degree view of each farmer, including their landholdings. 
    * **Plot:** To track details for each parcel of land, including soil type and irrigation source. 
    * **Crop Cycle:** To log seasonal crop data for analysis. 
    * **Subsidy Application:** To streamline and manage the entire subsidy lifecycle. 
3.  **Configured Navigation:** I created tabs for all custom objects and added them to the app's navigation bar for easy access.
